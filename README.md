## Overview

This was a good project to work on and grow front end skills. It is desktop and mobile friendly. I took a desktop first approach and then adapted it to mobile. No frameworks or libraries just used regular HTML, CSS and JS. I did use SCSS to make the styling a little easier.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Open a lightbox gallery by clicking on the large product image
- Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images
- Add items to the cart
- View the cart and remove items from it
